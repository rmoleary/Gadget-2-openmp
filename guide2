remark #30761: Add -parallel option if you want the compiler to generate recommendations for improving auto-parallelization.

allvars.h(509): remark #30755: (DTRANS) Reordering the fields of the structure 'particle_data' will improve data locality. Suggested field order: 'Pos, Mass, Ti_endstep, Ti_begstep, Vel, GravAccel, Potential, OldAcc, ID, Type, GravCost, AphysOld'. [VERIFY] The suggestion is based on the field references in the current compilation. Please make sure that the restructured code satisfies the original program semantics.

allvars.h(550): remark #30756: (DTRANS) Split the structure 'sph_particle_data' into two parts to improve data locality. Frequently accessed fields are 'Density, Hsml, VelPred, Pressure, DhsmlDensityFactor, DivVel'; performance may improve by putting these fields into one structure and the remaining fields into another structure. Alternatively, performance may also improve by reordering the fields of the structure. Suggested field order: 'Density, Hsml, VelPred, Pressure, DhsmlDensityFactor, DivVel, CurlVel, DtEntropy, HydroAccel, MaxSignalVel, Entropy, Left, Right, NumNgb, Rot'. [VERIFY] The suggestion is based on the field references in the current compilation. Please make sure that the restructuring is applied to field references in all source files of the application, and that the restructured code satisfies the original program semantics.

allvars.h(509): remark #30760: (DTRANS) Remove unused field(s) 'Vel, GravAccel, Potential, OldAcc, ID, Type, GravCost, AphysOld' from the struct 'particle_data'. The fields: 'Pos' were conservatively assumed by the compiler as referenced since their address is taken. [VERIFY] The suggestion is based on the field references in the current compilation. Please make sure that there are no references to these fields across the entire application.
